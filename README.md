# Inventory Demand Forecasting

This project focuses on using statistical models, specifically ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), for inventory demand forecasting using the R programming language. The goal is to predict future inventory demand with the utmost accuracy.

## Problem Statement

Inventory management is crucial for businesses to optimize their operations and maintain a balance between excess and insufficient inventory. To make informed decisions, it's essential to forecast demand accurately. This project addresses the challenge of predicting inventory demand, aiming to reduce the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) by implementing advanced statistical models.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Analysis

Before applying any forecasting model, a thorough analysis of historical demand data is performed to understand patterns, trends, and seasonality. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial in this phase.

### 2. Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, outlier detection, and data transformation, making the dataset ready for modeling.

### 3. Time Series Analysis

The project primarily employs ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models for time series analysis. ARIMA models are suitable for capturing temporal dependencies and can adapt to changing patterns over time.

### 4. Model Training

The ARIMA model is trained on historical demand data, optimizing model parameters, such as order (p, d, q), to achieve the best forecasting performance.

### 5. Evaluation

The project aims to achieve a low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) as a measure of forecasting accuracy. The evaluation process includes comparing the model's predictions with actual demand and analyzing the forecast errors.

## Results

The ARIMA model implemented in this project has successfully achieved a 10% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in inventory demand forecasting. This indicates a high level of accuracy in predicting future inventory demand, allowing businesses to make more informed inventory management decisions.
